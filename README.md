LaserGame
=========
A group project we were mucking around with for an hour or so each week. Went through various prototypes (JS -> Java -> Unity3D).
The idea was to make a puzzle game based on lasers and mirrors. We played around with both continuous lasers, and very discrete lasers (not acting like light in real life).
Have a look at how it evolved over time, and feel free to do what you like with the code.
