Fire the laser:

* Get line between point and mouse
  - Create line segment from two points

* Represent location and speed as a line segment
  - Set line segment length

* Display laser as set length
  - Set line segment length

* Move line by speed every second
  - Get vector from line segment (and multiply by time passed)
  - Move line segment by vector

* Reflect point and velocity if laser crossed a line in a frame
  - Calculate if line segment collides with line segment
  - Sort by distances to collisions
  - (if so) Move to collision, remove appropriate amount of simulation time, continue simulation

* Reflect visible portions of laser in the same way
